# Perlin-Noise

My perlin noise function shows a small diagram of both a 1 dimensional array perlin noise and a 2 dimensional array of perlin noise.
The perlin noise functions used are created by myself. The functions require the following arguements (N dimensional double array filled with random noise, double step).
step is used to determin how steep the output array is. (1 is really steep, 0 is flat)

## 1 dimensional array

The mode1 display will show 4 diagrams.

### Diagram 1

The first diagram is of random noise that is inputed into the perlin noise function.

### Diagram 2

The Second diagram is the outputed perlin noise.

### Diagram 3

The third diagram is the outputed perlin noise used in an example terrain generator(green land, Blue water).

### Diagram 4

The fourth diagram is diagram 3 looping across the x axes.
This is used to show that the output of the perlin noiss functions is tileable. (seemlessly looping infinitely)

## 2 dimensional array

The mode1 display will show 4 diagrams.

### Diagram 1

The first diagram is of random noise that is inputed into the perlin noise function.

### Diagram 2

The Second diagram is the outputed perlin noise.

### Diagram 3

The third diagram is the outputed perlin noise used in an example terrain generator/height map (green land, Blue water).

### Diagram 4

The fourth diagram is diagram 3 looping across the x and y axes randomly.
This is used to show that the output of the perlin noiss functions is tileable. (seemlessly looping infinitely)
